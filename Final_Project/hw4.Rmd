## HW4

In this assignment, I'll be importing my final project dataset and exploring the structure. I am hesitant to do anayslses yet/make plots because this dataset needs to be *heavily* modified before the data can properly be analyzed.


```{r data}
library(readxl)
sm_currency <- read_excel(here::here("Final_Project/data/sm_currency.xlsx"))
View(sm_currency)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
