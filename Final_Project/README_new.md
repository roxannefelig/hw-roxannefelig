# Roxanne's New Final Project 

**Folder Information**

This is a folder for hosting and posting my final project Programming with Data. This will hold my data, syntax, and any other neccessary information.


**Brief Introduction**

:sparkles: About this project :sparkles:

My goal with this project is to predict the extent to which images of women on social media are perceived as sexualized as a function of posture and revealing clothing. My main goal is to re-structure the data file to allow me to do the proper EMA analayses.

**Data Organization**

Missing values are coded as 'NA'. Each acronym (e.g "NSNR") corresponds to a category of photo that participants were shown. Each category has 10 photos (NSNR1-NSNR10). Each photo was rated for how revealing it was, how sexual the posture seemed, how attractive the woman was, and how sexualized the photo seemed overall. 

To imnprove this organization, I plan to re-label each column so that each photo is labeled 1-10. That is, I will get rid of the acronyms before each value. Then, I will need to make the table longer, where each participant has a row of data for each of the 40 photos, with colums labeled "photo", "revealing", "posture", "attractive", and "sexualized".
