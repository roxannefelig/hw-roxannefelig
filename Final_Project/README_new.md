# Roxanne's New Final Project 

**Folder Information**

This is a folder for hosting and posting my final project Programming with Data. This will hold my data, syntax, and any other neccessary information.


**Brief Introduction**

:sparkles: About this project :sparkles:

This project explores the relationship between self-objectification (the extent to which an individual takes an observer's perspective of their own body), body awareness (awareness and ability to recognize internal bodily states), and intuitive eating (an eating style based on physiological hunger and satiety cues). Previous research has found relationships between self-objectification and body awareness, self-objectification and intuitive eating, and body awareness and intuitive eating, but to my knowledge no research explores the relationship between the three constructs. 

I have collected correlational data from both undergraduates in the SONA participant pool which will test a mediational model, whereby self-objectification reduces intuitive eating, mediated by reduced body awareness. For this project, I will be cleaning the data set, reverse scoring items, creating summary scores, and wil begin to explore the data.

**Data Organization**

Missing values are coded as 'NA'. Each acronym (e.g "NSNR") corresponds to a category of photo that participants were shown. Each category has 10 photos (NSNR1-NSNR10). Each photo was rated for how revealing it was, how sexual the posture seemed, how attractive the woman was, and how sexualized the photo seemed overall. 

To imnprove this organization, I plan to re-label each column so that each photo is labeled 1-10. That is, I will get rid of the acronyms before each value. Then, I will need to make the table longer, where each participant has a row of data for each of the 40 photos, with colums labeled "photo", "revealing", "posture", "attractive", and "sexualized".
