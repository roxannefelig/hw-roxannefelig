```

## Final Project Introduction

```{r load packages}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(psych)
library(naniar)
library(reshape2)
library(scales)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
