**Brief Introduction**

:sparkles: Hello world! :sparkles:

I'm a third year PhD student in the Social area, and I primarily study women's experiences with self-objectification, particularly in the context of social media. I am _finally_ submitting my thesis for publication this month, which explored the consequences of selfie editing on women's self perceptions. Fun facts about me are that I am from Hawai'i and was in the circus when I was younger!
